Clarity: Focus & Pomodoro - Privacy Policy
Last Updated: January 8, 2026

Thank you for using "Clarity". Your privacy is extremely important to us. This policy explains how we handle your data with the utmost respect and transparency.

Our philosophy is simple: Your focus data belongs to you.

1. Data Storage & Synchronization
Your Personal Data Clarity stores your Pomodoro sessions, categories, goals, and settings locally on your device.

☁️ iCloud Synchronization Clarity uses Apple's iCloud services to synchronize your data across your devices (iPhone, iPad).

Your data is stored in your private iCloud container.

We (the developers) cannot access, read, or share this data.

You can disable iCloud synchronization at any time in your device settings.

2. Subscriptions & Payments (Clarity Plus)
We offer a premium subscription ("Clarity Plus") to unlock advanced features.

💰 Payment Processing All payments are processed securely by Apple via the App Store.

❌ We never see or store your credit card information.

❌ We do not have access to your billing address.

🔗 Subscription Management (RevenueCat) We use a trusted third-party service called RevenueCat to manage and validate your subscription status.

RevenueCat uses an anonymous App User ID to check if you have an active "Clarity Plus" subscription.

No personally identifiable information (Name, Email, Address) is sent to RevenueCat.

3. What Information Do We Collect?
We do not collect, request, or store any personally identifiable information from you (Name, Email, Phone Number, Location).

Anonymous Usage Data We do not track your behavior inside the app. We do not use analytics tools like Google Analytics or Mixpanel. Your focus sessions are private.

4. Third-Party Services
To provide a seamless experience, Clarity uses the following trusted services:

Apple iCloud: For data synchronization. Apple Privacy Policy

RevenueCat: For subscription infrastructure. RevenueCat Privacy Policy

Clarity never uses:

❌ Advertising networks (No Ads)

❌ Data brokers

❌ Social media tracking pixels

5. Notifications
Clarity requests permission to send local notifications to inform you when your focus session or break ends.

These notifications are generated entirely on your device.

No data is sent to external servers to trigger these notifications.

6. Children's Privacy
Clarity is safe for users of all ages, including children under 13. Since we do not collect any personal data, there are no privacy risks for children.
